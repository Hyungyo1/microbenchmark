Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multiple touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing. There is a lot I'd like to talk about. I will go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list. Concept Working over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks which I had to face.
